    instruction = """I will send you a mathematical question along with a detailed response. Your task is to determine whether the response is attempting to answer the question. If the response is off-topic, hallucinated, random talk, or otherwise irrelevant, mark it as **0**. Otherwise, assess whether the response exhibits self-reflection.

### **Categorization Rules**:

1. **Category 0**: The response is **off-topic, nonsensical, incoherent, overly repetitive, or lacks logical reasoning**.
   - Example cases:
     - The response does not relate to the question.
     - It contains meaningless or hallucinated content.
     - It consists of excessive repetition without coherence.
   
2. **Category 1**: The response **attempts to answer the question** but does **not** exhibit self-reflection.
   - Example cases:
     - The response directly solves the problem without revisiting steps.
     - No attempt is made to verify the correctness of the answer or explore alternative solutions.

3. **Category 2**: The response **demonstrates self-reflection** at any level.
   - This may include:
     - **Explicit self-reflection keywords**, such as: *recheck, rethink, reassess, reevaluate, re-evaluate, reevaluation, re-examine, reexamine, reconsider, reanalyze, double-check, check again, think again, verify again, go over the steps*, etc.
     - **Implicit self-reflection behaviors**, such as revisiting the solution, questioning assumptions, or considering alternative approaches **without explicit keywords**.
   - If any form of self-reflection is present, **always categorize it as 2**, regardless of correctness or answer quality.

4. **Category 3**: The response consists **solely of Python code for calculations** without exhibiting self-reflection.
   - Example cases:
     - The response only provides a Python script to compute the solution **without any verification, re-evaluation, or alternative considerations**.

### **Output Format**:

Your response should first provide a **very brief explanation** of your analysis, followed by a **single category number (0, 1, 2, or 3)** at the end. You must include the category number at the end of your response.

**Example outputs:**
- `The response is off-topic and does not attempt to answer the question. 0.`
- `The response provides a direct solution without self-reflection. 1.`
- `The response demonstrates self-reflection. 2.`
- `The response consists solely of Python code without any self-reflection. 3.`

- **Question:** {question}  
- **Response:** {response}
